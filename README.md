## Overview

As a company we are big advocates of the open source community. We benefit hugely from the use of open source software, including Linux, Apache, Ruby, Python and many other tools/languages, so we feel that it is our duty to give something back.

We release a lot of tools, libraries etc via github and make use of a number of different organsations in order to do that. Below is a list of all of the organisations that we contribute to or release via.
